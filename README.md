# Linked List Implementation in Python

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Linked List, showcasing various operations such as insertion, deletion, reversal, and traversal. The Linked List is a fundamental data structure that allows for efficient management of dynamically sized collections of elements.

## Features

- **Node Class:** Represents each element in the linked list, containing data and a reference to the next node.
- **LinkedList Class:** Manages the linked list with methods for various operations.
  - **Insertion:**
    - `append(data)`: Insert a node at the end of the list.
    - `prepend(data)`: Insert a node at the beginning of the list.
    - `insert(data, position)`: Insert a node at a specific position.
  - **Deletion:**
    - `pop()`: Remove and return the last node.
    - `delete_at(position)`: Remove a node at a specific position.
  - **Other Operations:**
    - `size()`: Return the number of nodes in the list.
    - `reverse()`: Reverse the order of nodes in the list.
    - `print_list()`: Print the linked list in a readable format.

## Usage

To get started, clone the repository and explore the `linked_list.py` file to understand the implementation details and see example usage.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TonyBhaskar/linked-list-repository
cd linked-list-implementation
